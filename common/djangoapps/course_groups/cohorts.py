# A 'default cohort' is an auto-cohort that is automatically created for a course if no auto_cohort_groups have been
# specified. It is intended to be used in a cohorted-course for users who have yet to be assigned to a cohort.
# Note 1: If an administrator chooses to configure a cohort with the same name, the said cohort will be used as
#         the "default cohort".
# Note 2: If auto_cohort_groups are configured after the 'default cohort' has been created and populated, the
#         stagnant 'default cohort' will still remain (now as a manual cohort) with its previously assigned students.

#                   and needed across product boundaries.
