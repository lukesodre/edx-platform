edXML is the XML-based standard used to build courses for the edX Platform.

You specify course content in edXML. You can then manage the course with edX
Studio, and present the course to students through the edX Learning Management
System (LMS).

edXML is based on XML. XML, or Extensible Markup Language, is a set of rules
for creating documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-
readable.

To work with edXML, you should have a strong understanding of XML. This
document presumes you understand XML and can use tools to create and edit XML
files.

For a primer on XML, see the `Wikipedia XML entry`_ .
